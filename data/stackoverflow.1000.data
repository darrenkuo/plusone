substantial amount time memory execute jit compiler user waiting compiler runs coupled problem possibility deriving benefit compilation expensive optimization techniques ruled static compilation advantages it's slow e.g building large system it's typically carried server spends time waiting second executable generated times people minimizes cost optimization second amortizes smaller cost larger number executions mentioned original question web sites jit compilation possibility greater awareness target environment theoretically offset advantage there's question factor offset disadvantage static compilation specific types code target environments outweigh advantages static compilation testing experience fairly unusual target dependent optimizations fairly small differences
